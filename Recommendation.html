            <p>When it comes to recommending things to students, many things should be taken into consideration such as availabilty, functionality and pricing.
                As an It specialist, I have come out with a list of recommendations for the upcoming Creative Multimedia Creation students.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Computer System</b></h4>
            <p>I would recommend students to get a <b>laptop computer</b>. As a college student, having a portable computer is important because students can carry it around from 
                class to class without any problem. If students buy a desktop computer, they cannot carry it around because it is big and heavy. Besides that, nowadays laptops
                are equipped with processors that are as powerful as in the ones in a regular desktop. Thus, students dont have to worry about their laptop not being powerful enough to complete 
                their assingments or projects. 
            </p>
            <h4><b>Operating System</b></h4>
            <p>When it comes to operating system, I would recommend students to invest in the <b>Windows</b> operating system. With Windows, students are able to get control over their
                 computer. Students can download things from third parties such as from the Internet for free and without any restriction. In macOS, students are unable to download anything from third parties and also 
                 very limited customization. Secondly, students can get cheap support for their Windows device. There are much more computer shops that repairs and service Windows computer than Mac.
                 Thus, the cost of repairing a Windows machine is much more lower than a Mac. Repairing a macOS machine will be very costly because there are very few shops that repairs them. 
            </p>
            <h4><b>Internet Package</b></h4>
            <p>The Internet plan that I would recommend students to get is the <b>TM Unifi Pro Plan 100</b>.The Internet package is sold by our local Internet service provider Telekom Malaysia(TM).
                 The pros of getting this Internet plan is<b>:</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>-</b>For the price of RM129.00 per month, students are getting more for their money than other Internet plans. Students are getting free 600 minutes of phone calling, TV packs, and a high performance wireless router.
            <br>
            <b>-</b>The Internet plan has a large coverage. Thus, students don't have to worry about not having Internet connection at their homes.
            <br>
            <b>-</b>Good customer service. The Internet provider is well known for their quick response when there are any problems occurs.
            </p>
            <h4><b>System design</b></h4>
            <p>Choosing the right computer specification is crucial because it plays an important role in making contents or completing projects. The table below is my recommended laptop specification
                for the students.
            </p>
            <table class="w3-table-all w3-centered w3-card-4 ">
                <caption>System specification</caption>
                <tr>
                    <th><b>Components</b></th>
                    <th><b>Recommended</b></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Processor</td>
                    <td>Intel i5 (8th generation and above) or AMD Ryzen 5 3000 series and above</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>Windows 10 Home 64bit x84</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Graphic Card</td>
                    <td>Nvidia Mx250 and above</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Storage</td>
                    <td>512 Gb Solid State Drive(SSD)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Display</td>
                    <td>15.6-inch In Plane Switching(IPS) display</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Network Adapter</td>
                    <td>Wi-Fi card that supports Wi-Fi 5 and above</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Software</td>
                    <td>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe illustrator, Adobe Flash, Adobe Premiere, Adobe Aftereffect, Kaspersky</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Based on the specification above, the computer will handle workloads easily and it will also have a long lifespan. Students should choose a quad core processor than dual core processor because
                a quad core processor can render things faster than a dual core processor. As a Creative Multimedia Creation student, having a graphic card is crucial because it helps in rendering large projects
                such as videos or editing images. Besides that, a graphic card also allow students to play some games during their free time. High amount of Random Accessing Memory(RAM) helps the computer to run smoothly even though there are many things
                opened at the same time. Having a colour accurate display is very important for a content creator because it will let them to see colours more accurately when editing vidoes or images.
