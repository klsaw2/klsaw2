            <p>When students wants to purchase a new personal computer, they always ask<b>" Which is better? macOs or Windows?</b>. As an IT specialist,
                I can help students to make a decision by listing down the differences between them. Seeing the differences can help students to decide which operating
                system they would like to invest in.
